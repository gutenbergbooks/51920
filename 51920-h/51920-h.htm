      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>UR friend, the Old
      Soak, came in from his home in Flatbush to see us not long ago, in
      anything but a jovial mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that some persons think there is still hope for a liberal
      interpretation of the law so that beer and light wines may be sold,&rdquo; said
      we.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope,&rdquo; said he, moodily, &ldquo;is a fine thing, but it don't gurgle none when
      you pour it out of a bottle. Hope is all right, and so is Faith... but
      what I would like to see is a little Charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as Hope is concerned, I'd rather have Despair combined with a case
      of Bourbon liquor than all the Hope in the world by itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope is what these here fellows has got that is tryin' to make their own
      with a tea-kettle and a piece of hose. That's awful stuff, that is.
      There's a friend of mine made some of that stuff and he was scared of it,
      and he thinks before he drinks any he will try some of it onto a dumb
      beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there ain't no dumb beast anywheres handy, so he feeds some of it to
      his wife's parrot. That there parrot was the only parrot I ever knowed of
      that wasn't named Polly. It was named Peter, and was supposed to be a
      gentleman parrot for the last eight or ten years. But whether it was or
      not, after it drank some of that there home-made hootch Peter went and
      laid an egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That there home-made stuff ain't anything to trifle with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's like amateur theatricals. Amateur theatricals is all right for an
      occupation for them that hasn't got anything to do nor nowhere to go, but
      they cause useless agony to an audience. Home-made booze may be all right
      to take the grease spots out of the rugs with, but it ain't for the human
      stomach to drink. Home-made booze is either a farce with no serious kick
      to it, or else a tragedy with an unhappy ending. No, sir, as soon as what
      is left has been drank I will kiss good-bye to the shores of this land of
      holiness and suffering and go to some country where the vegetation just
      naturally works itself up into liquor in a professional manner, and end my
      days in contentment and iniquity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; he continued, with a faint gleam of hope, &ldquo;the smuggling
      business develops into what it ought to. And it may. There's some friends
      of mine already picked out a likely spot on the shores of Long Island and
      dug a hole in the sand that kegs might wash into if they was throwed from
      passing vessels. They've hoisted friendly signals, but so far nothing has
      been throwed overboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a little of the right sort on his hip, and after refreshing
      himself, he announced:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm writing a diary. A diary of the past. A kind of gol-dinged
      autobiography of what me and Old King Booze done before he went into the
      grave and took one of my feet with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In just a little while now there won't be any one in this here broad land
      of ours, speaking of it geographically, that knows what an old-fashioned
      barroom was like. They'll meet up with the word, future generations of
      posterity will, and wonder and wonder and wonder just what a saloon could
      have resembled, and they will cudgel their brains in vain, as the poet
      says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often in my own perusal of reading matter I run onto institutions that I
      would like to know more of. But no one ever set down and described 'em
      because everyone knowed all about them in the time when the writing was
      done. Often I thought I would 'a' liked to knowed all about them Hanging
      Gardens of Babylon, for instance, and who was hanged in 'em and what for;
      but nobody ever described 'em, as fur as I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got any of it written?&rdquo; we asked him. &ldquo;Here's the start of it,&rdquo;
       said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      We present it just as the Old Soak penned it.

      CHAPTER TWO&mdash;Beginning the Old Soak's History of the Rum Demon
    </h2>

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> WILL hereinunder
      set down nothing but what is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but
      the truth, so help me God. Well, in the old days, before everybody got so
      gosh-amighty good, barrooms was so frequent that nobody thought of setting
      down their scenery and habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually you went into it by a pair of swinging doors that met in the
      middle and didn't go full length up, so you could see over the top of the
      door, and if any one was to come into one door you didn't want to have
      talk with or anything you could see him and have a chance to gravitate out
      the door at the other end of the barroom while he was getting in. But you
      couldn't see into the windows of them as a habitual custom, because who
      could tell whether a customer's family was going to pass by and glance in.
      Well, in your heart you knew you was doing nothing to be ashamed of, but
      all families even in the good old days contained some prohibition
      relations. The Good Book says that flies in the ointment send forth a
      smell to heaven. Well, you felt more private like with the windows fixed
      thataway. They was painted, soaped, and some stained glassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had its good sides and it had its bad sides, but I will say I have been
      completely out of touch, just as much as if I was a native of some hot
      country, with all kinds of morality and religions of all sorts, ever since
      the barrooms was shut up. From childhood's earliest hours religion has
      been one of my favourite studies, and I never let a week pass without I
      get down on my knees some time or another and pray about something any
      more than I would let a week pass without I washed all over. It was early
      recollections of a good woman that kept me religious, and I hope I do not
      have to say anything further to this gang. Well, in spite of my religion I
      never went to church none. Because it ain't reasonable to suppose that a
      man could keep awake. He thinks, &ldquo;What if I should nod,&rdquo; and he does. So
      that always throwed me back onto the barrooms for my religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, then, the first thing you know when you are up by the free lunch
      counter eating some of that delicatessen in comes a girl and says to
      contribute to the cause. Well, &ldquo;What cause are you?&rdquo; you ask her. Well,
      she says, Salvation Army or the Volunteers, or what not, and so forth, as
      the case may be, or maybe she was boosting for some of these new religions
      that gets out a paper and these girls go around and sell it for ten cents,
      which they always set a date for the world coming to an end. Well, then,
      you got a line on her religion, and you was ashamed not to give her a
      quarter, for you had spent a dollar for drinks already that morning. And
      then all through the day there was other religions come in, one after
      another, or maybe the same religion over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, then, you kept in touch with religions and it made a better man out
      of you, and along about evening time when you figured on going home you
      felt like it wouldn't be right to tell any pervarications to your wife
      about how you come to be so late, so you just said over the phone: &ldquo;I am
      starting right away. I stopped into Ed's place to play a game of pool
      after work and met a fellow I used to know. I couldn't get away from him
      and I was too thoughtful of you to insist for him to come home to dinner
      so he insisted I ought to have a drink with him for old time's sake.&rdquo; And
      if it hadn't been for being in contact with different religions all day
      you would of lied outright to your wife and felt mean as a dog about it
      when she found you out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, then, it needs no further proof that the abolishment of the saloon
      has taken away the common people's religions from them, but it is my
      message to tell just what the barrooms was like and not to criticize the
      laws of the land, even when they are dam-foolish as so many of them are.
      So I will confine myself to describing the barroom and the rum demon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I never saw much rum drunk in the places where I hung out. Sometimes
      some baccardy into a cocktail, but for my part cocktails always struck me
      as wicked. The good book says that the Lord started the people right but
      that men had made many adventures. Well, then, I took mine straight for
      the most part, except when I needed some special kind of a pick-up in the
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the good book says not to tarry long over the wine cup, and I never
      done that, neither, except a little Rhine wine in the summer time, but
      mostly took mine straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, then, to come down to describing these phantom places over which the
      raven says nevermore but the posterity of the future may wish to have its
      own say so about. Well, there was a long counter always kept wiped off,
      not like these here sticky soda-water counters which the boys and girls
      back of them always look sticky, too, and their sleeves look sticky and
      the glasses is sticky, but in a decent barroom the counter was kept swiped
      off clean and selfrespectable.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was a brass rail with cuspidors near to it, if you wanted to
      cuspidate it was handy right there, and there's no place to hawk and
      cuspidate in these here soda-water dives. Not that I ever been in them
      much. All that stuff rots the lining of your stomach. As far as I am
      concerned, being the posterity of a lot of Scotch ancestors, I never liked
      soft stuff in my insides.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never drunk nothing but whiskey for comfort and pleasure, and I never
      took no medicine in my life except calomel, and I always held to the
      Presbyterian religion as my favourite religion because those three things
      has got some kick when took inside of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, then, to get down to telling just what these places was like, it
      would surprise this generation of posterity how genteel some of them was.
      Which I will come down to in my next chapter. Well, I will close this
      chapter.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> NEVER could see
      liquor drinking as a bad habit,&rdquo; said the Old Soak, &ldquo;though I admit fair
      and free it will lead to bad habits if it ain't watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In these here remarks of mine, I aim to tell the truth, and nothing but
      the truth, so help me Jehorsophat, as the good book says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One feller I knowed whose liquor drinking led to bad habits was my old
      friend Hennery Simms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every time Hennery got anyways jingled he used to fall downstairs, and he
      fell down so often that it got to be a habit and you couldn't call it
      nothing else. He thought he had to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One time late at night I was going over to Brooklyn on the subway, and I
      seen one of these here escalators with Hennery onto it moving upwards,
      only Hennery wasn't riding on his feet, he was riding on the spine of his
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when he got to the top of the thing and it skated him out onto the
      level, what does Hennery do but pitch himself onto it again, head first,
      and again he was carried up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After I seen him do that three or four times I rode up to where Hennery
      was floundering at and I ast him what was he doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I'm falling downstairs,' says Hennery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What you doing that fur?' I says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I'm drunk, ain't I?' says Hennery. 'You old fool, you knows I always
      falls downstairs when I'm drunk.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'How many times you goin' to fall down these here stairs?' I ast him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I ain't fell down these here stairs once yet,' says Hennery, 'though I
      must of tried to a dozen times. I been tryin' to fall down these here
      stairs ever since dusk set in, but they's something wrong about 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'If I didn't know I was drunk, I would swear these here stairs was
      movin'.'
    </p>
    <p>
      '&ldquo;They be movin',' I tells him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You go about your business,' he says, 'and don't mock a man that's doing
      the best he can. In course they ain't movin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'They only looks like they was movin' to me because I'm drunk. You can't
      fool me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I left him still tryin' to fall down them stairs, and still bein'
      carried up again. Which, as I remarked at first, only goes to show that
      drink will lead to habits if it ain't watched, even when it ain't a habit
      itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you have any more of your History of the Rum Demon written?&rdquo; we asked
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uh-huh,&rdquo; said he, and left us the second installment.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FOUR&mdash;The Old Soak's History&mdash;The Barroom as an
      Educative Influence
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ELL, as I said in
      my first installment, some 'of them barrooms was such genteel places they
      would surprise you if you had got the idea that they was all gems of
      iniquity and wickedness with the bartenders mostly in clean collars and
      their hair slicked, not like so many of these soda-water places, where the
      hair is stringy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, this is for future generations of posterity that will have never saw
      a saloon, and the whole truth is to be set down, so help me God, and I
      will say that it took a good deal of sweeping sometimes to keep the floor
      clean and often the free lunch was approached with one fork for several
      people, especially the beans. Well, it has been three or four years even
      before that Eighteenth Commandment passed since free lunch was what it
      once was. And some barrooms was under par. But I am speaking of the
      average good class barroom, where you would take your own children or
      grandchildren, as the case may be.
    </p>
    <p>
      They was some very kind-hearted places among them where if a man had spent
      all his money already for his own good they would refuse to let him have
      anything more to drink until maybe someone set them up for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to get down to brass tacks and describe what they looked like more
      thoroughly I will say they was always attractive to me with those long
      expensive mirrors and brass fixtures like a scene of elegance and grandeur
      out of the Old Testament where it tells of Solomon in all his glory. And
      if a gent would forget to be genteel after he took too much and his money
      was all spent and imbue himself with loud talk or rough language and maybe
      want to hit somebody and there was none of his friends there to take
      charge of him often I have seen such throwed out on their ear, for the
      better class places always aimed to be decent and orderly and never to
      have an indecent reputation for loudness and roughhouseness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I will say I have not kept up with politics like I used to since the
      barrooms was vanished. My eyes ain't what they used to be and the
      newspapers are different from each other so who can tell what to believe,
      but in the old days you could keep in touch with politics in the barrooms.
      It made a better citizen out of you for every man ought to vote for what
      his consciousness tells him is right and to abide in politics by his
      consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, closing the barroom has shut off my chance to be imbued with
      political dope and who to bet on in the next election and I am not so good
      a citizen as before the saloons was closed. I would not know who to bet on
      in any election but I used to get straight tips and in that way took an
      interest in politics which a man is scarcely to be called an American
      citizen unless he does.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well I see everywhere where all the doctors and science sharks says to
      keep in touch with outdoor sports if you want to keep young. I used to
      know all about all those outdoor sports and who the Giants had bought and
      what they paid for him and who was the best pitcher and what the dope was
      on tomorrow's entries at Havana, but all that is taken away from me now
      the saloons is closed and I got no chance to get into touch with outdoor
      sports and I feel it in my health. Some of these days the Prohibition
      aliments will wake up and see they have ruined the country but then it
      will be too late. Taking the sports away from a nation is not going to do
      it any good when the next war comes along if one does.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I promised I would describe more what they looked like. I will
      tackle that in the next chapter, so I will bring this installment to a
      close.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HEY'RE going to
      take our tobacco next, are they?&rdquo; said the Old Soak. &ldquo;Well, me, I won't
      struggle none! I ain't fit to struggle. I'm licked; my heart's broke. They
      can come and take my blood if they want it, and all I'll do is ask 'em
      whether they'll have it a drop at a time, or the whole concerns in a
      bucket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I say is: <i>Watch out for Crime Waves!</i> I don't threaten nobody,
      I just predict. If you ever waked up about 1 o'clock in the morning, two
      or three miles from a store, and that store likely closed, and no
      neighbour near by, and the snow drifting the roads shut, and wanted a
      smoke, and there wasn't a single crumb of tobacco nowheres in the house,
      you know what I mean. You go and look for old cigar and cigarette butts to
      crumble into your pipe, and there ain't none. You go through all your
      clothes for little mites of tobacco that have maybe jolted into your
      pockets, and there ain't none. Your summer clothes is packed away into the
      bottom of a trunk somewheres, and you wake your wife to find the key to
      the trunk, and you get the clothes and there ain't no tobacco in them
      pockets, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then you and your wife has words. And you sit and suffer and cuss and
      chew the stem of your empty pipe. By 3 in the morning there ain't no
      customary crime known you wouldn't commit. By 4 o'clock you begin to think
      of new crimes, and how you'd like to commit them and then make up comic
      songs about 'em and go and sing them songs at the funerals of them you've
      slew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark to me: If tobacco goes next, there'll be a crime wave! Take away a
      man's booze, and he dies, or embraces dope or religion, or goes abroad, or
      makes it at home, or drinks varnish, or gets philosophical or something.
      But tobacco! No, sir! There ain't any substitute. Why, the only way
      they're getting away with this booze thing now is because millions and
      millions of shattered nerves is solacing and soothing theirselves with
      tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm mild, myself. I won't explode. I'm getting my booze. I know where
      there's plenty of it. My heart's broke to see the saloons closed, and I'm
      licked by the overwhelming righteous... but I won't suffer any personal
      for a long time yet. But there's them that will. And on top of everything
      else, tobacco is to go! All right, take it&mdash;but I say solemn and
      warningly: <i>Look Out For Crime Waves!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The godly and the righteous can push us wicked persons just so far, but
      worms will turn. Look at the Garden of Eden! The mammal of iniquity ain't
      never yet been completely abolished. Look at the history of the world&mdash;every
      once in a while it has always looked as if the pious and the uplifter was
      going to bring in the millennium, with bells on it&mdash;but something has
      always happened just in time and the mammal of unrighteousness has come
      into his own again. I ain't threatening; I just predict&mdash;-<i>Look Out
      For Crime Waves!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for me, I may never see Satan come back home. I'm old. I ain't long
      for this weary land of purity and this vale of tears and virtue. I'll soon
      be in a place where the godly cease from troubling and the wicked are at
      rest. But I got children and grandchildren that'll fight against the
      millennium to the last gasp, if I know the breed, and I'm going to pass on
      full of hope and trust and calm belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; concluded the Old Soak, unscrewing the top of his pocket flask,
      &ldquo;here is to the mammal of unrighteousness!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER SIX&mdash;Continuing the Old Soak's History&mdash;The Barroom and
      the Arts
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ELL, I promised to
      describe what the saloon that has been banished was like so that future
      generations of posterity will know what it was like they never having seen
      one. And maybe being curious, which I would give a good deal to know how
      they got all their animals into the ark only nobody that was on the spot
      thought to write it down and figure the room for the stalls and cages and
      when it comes to that how did they train animals to talk in those days
      like Balaam and his ass, and Moses knocking the water out of the rocks
      always interested me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which I will tell the truth, so help me. It used to be this way: some had
      tables and some did not. But I never was much of a one for tables, for if
      you set down your legs don't tell you anything about how you are standing
      it till you get up and find you have went further than you intended, but
      if you stand up your legs gives you a warning from time to time you better
      not have but one more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I will tell the truth. And one thing is the treating habit was a
      great evil. They would come too fast, and you would take a light drink
      like Rhine wine whilst they was coming too fast and that way use up
      considerable room that you could of had more advantage from if you had
      saved it for something important.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the good book says to beware of wine and evil communications
      corrupts a good many. Well, what I always wanted was that warm feeling
      that started about the equator and spread gentle all over you till you
      loved your neighbour as the good book says and wine never had the
      efficiency for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I will say even if the treating habit was a great evil it is an ill
      wind that blows nobody any good. Well, I promised to come down to brass
      tacks and describe what the old-time barroom looked like. Some of the old
      timers had sawdust on the floor, which I never cared much for that as it
      never looked genteel to me and almost anything might be mixed into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will tell the whole truth, so help me. And another kick I got is about
      business advantages. Which you used to be lined up by the bar five or six
      of you and suppose you was in the real estate business or something a
      fellow would say he had an idea that such and such a section would be
      going to have a boom and that started you figuring on it. Well, I missed a
      lot of business opportunities like that since the barroom has been
      vanished. What can a country expect if it destroys all chances a man has
      got to get ahead in business? The next time they ask us for business as
      usual to win a war with this country will find out something about closing
      up all chances a man has to get tips on their business chances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the good book says to laugh and grow fat and since the barroom has
      been taken away, what chance you got to hear any new stories I would like
      to know. Well, so help me, I said I would tell the truth, and the truth is
      some of them stories was not fit to offer up along with your prayers, but
      at the same time you got acquainted with some right up-to-date fellows.
      Well, what I want to know is how could you blame a country for turning
      into Bolshevisitors if all chance for sociability is shut off by the
      government from the plain people?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the better class of them had pictures on the walls, and since they
      been taken away what chance has a busy man like me got to go to a museum
      and see all them works of art hand painted by artists and looking as slick
      and shiny as one of these here circus lithographs. Well, a country wants
      to look out what it is doing when it shuts off from the plain people all
      the chance to educate itself in the high arts and hand painting. Some of
      the frames by themselves must of been worth a good deal of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Good Book says you shalt not live by bread alone and if you ain't got
      a chance to educate your self in the high arts or nothing after a while
      this country will get to the place where all the foreign countries will
      laugh at us for we won't know good hand painting when we see it. Well,
      they was a story to all them hand paintings, and often when business was
      slack I used to talk with Ed the bartender about them paintings and what
      did he suppose they was about.
    </p>
    <p>
      What chance have I got to go and buy a box to set in every night at the
      Metropolitan Opera House I would like to know and hear singing. Well, the
      good book says not to have anything to do with a man that ain't got any
      music in his soul and the right kind of a crowd in the right kind of a
      barroom could all get to singing together and furnish me with music.
    </p>
    <p>
      A government that takes away all its music like that from the plain people
      had better watch out. Some of these days there will be another big war and
      what will they do without music. I always been fond of music and there
      ain't anywhere I can go that it sounds the same sort of warmed up and
      friendly and careless. Let alone taking away my chance to meet up with
      different religions taking away my music has been a big blow to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I will tell the truth so help me, it was a nice place to drop into
      on a rainy day; you don't want to be setting down at home on a rainy day,
      reading your Bible all the time. But since they been closed I had to do a
      lot of reading to get through the day somehow and the wife is too busy to
      talk to me and the rest of the family is at work or somewheres.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, another evil is I been doing too much reading and that will rot out
      your brains unless of course it is the good book and you get kind of mixed
      up with all them revelations and things. And you get tired figuring out
      almanacs and the book with 1,000 drummer's jokes in it don't sound so good
      in print as when a fellow tells them to you and I never was much of a one
      for novels. What I like is books about something you could maybe know
      about yourself and maybe some of them old-time wonders of the world with
      explanations of how they was made. But nobody that was on the spot took
      the trouble to explain a lot of them things which is why I am setting down
      what the barroom was like so help me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, in the next chapter I will describe it some more or future
      generations will have no notion of them without the Constitution of the
      United States changes its mind and comes to its census again.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Old Woman and
      me had quite an argument last Sunday,&rdquo; said the Old Soak. &ldquo;It ended up
      with her turning a saucepan full of hot peas onto my bald spot, which
      ain't no way to treat garden truck, with the cost of things what they be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I won one of these here moral victories, even if she did get the best
      of me and chase me out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all come about over some pie we had for dinner on Sunday. It looked
      like mince pie to me when she set it on the table, and I says to her why
      don't she make some rhubarb pie or apple pie or something, for this is a
      hell of a time of year to be having mince pie. And mince pie ain't no good
      anyhow unless you put a shot of brandy or hard cider into it. She knows I
      orter be careful what I put into my stomach, which is all to the bad since
      I can't get the right kind of drink any more, and I told her so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, then,' says she, 'this ain't mince pie. This is raisin pie.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Raisin pie!' I says, and I was shocked and scandalized. 'Raisin pie!
      Good lord, woman, are you crazy? You don't mean to say you've went and
      took hundreds and hundreds of good raisins and went and wasted them
      thataway by puttin' 'em in a <i>pie!</i> It's the most extravagant thing I
      ever hearn tell on! Ain't you got sense enough to know that in these days
      raisins ain't something you eat?'
    </p>
    <p>
      '&ldquo;Well, what are they, then?' she says.
    </p>
    <p>
      '&ldquo;Raisins, I told her, 'is something you make hootch out of, and you know
      I'm reduced to makin' my own stuff these days. And yet here you be,
      puttin' at least a quart of good raisins into a gosh-darned pie!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, one word led to another, and, as I said, she hit me with the peas.
      But I got away with that pie. I won the moral victory. I got that pie
      fermentin' now, in the bottom of a cask full of grape and berry juice and
      other truck I picked up here and there. No, sir, there ain't goin' to be
      no raisins wasted around my house by eatin' of 'em in this here time of
      need!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Old Soak was silent a moment, and then he said: &ldquo;This here installment
      of my diary of booze takes up that very point of quarrellin' with the Old
      Woman.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER EIGHT&mdash;The Old Soak's History&mdash;More Evils of Prohibition
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ELL, another kick
      I got on the abvolition of ' the barroom is the fact that you got to stay
      around home so much and that naturally leads to having a row with your
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      When there was barrooms my wife used to jaw me every time I come home
      anyways lit up and I just let her jaw me and there wasn't any row for I
      figured better let her get away with it who knows maybe she thinks she is
      right about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now I stick around home a good deal of the time and it leads to words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, she says to me, why don't you go and get a job of work of some kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I tell her, mind your own business I always been a good pervider
      ain't I. You have got five or six children working for you ain't you and a
      man that pervides his wife with five or six children to work for her is
      not going to listen to no back talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, she says, you ought to be ashamed to loaf around home all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I says, I'm thinking up a big business deal but that's the way with
      women they never understand they got to keep their mouth shut and give a
      man peace and quiet to do his thinking in so he can make them a good
      living all they think about is newfangled ways to spend the money after he
      has slaved himself half to death making it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, she says, I ain't seen you slaving any lately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I tells her, I done all my hard slaving when I was young and I got a
      little money coming in right along from them two houses I own, and I ain't
      going to work myself into the grave for no extravagant woman, and me with
      a heart pappitation you can hear half a mile on a clear day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, she says, what rent money them two houses brings in don't any more
      than pay for the booze you drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I says, you Prohibitionists done that to me. You went and made it
      plumb impossible to get good liquor for any reasonable price. That there
      rent money used to pay for three times the booze I drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, she says, you oughta get a job.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I was to tie myself down to a job, I tells her, what chance would I
      have to trade and dicker around and make little turnovers, let alone
      thinking up this big business deal I am working on.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are a liar, she said, and if I knowed where your whiskey was hid I'd
      bust every bottle and what kind of a business deal are you thinking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an invention I says to her and you mind your own business just
      because I have stood for you intrupting me for forty years is no sign I am
      going to stand for it forty years more.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can quit any time she says and good riddance the children will keep me
      and there will be one less to cook for besides being ashamed of you before
      all my own friends and the nice people the children know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I said, here I set turning over the leaves of the Bible and you
      attack me that way and me trying to think up a business deal to buy you an
      automobile and the pappitation in my heart that bad it shakes the chair I
      am setting in and if a man with one foot in the grave can't get any peace
      and quiet to read his Bible in his own home against the time he is going
      to cash in then I will say that Prohibition has brought this country to a
      pretty pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, she says, what is that pappitation from but all the liquor you
      drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is from my constitution, I says, as the doctor will tell you if it
      hadn't been for a little mite of stimulant now and then I would of cashed
      in long ago and you would now have the life insurance money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, she says, what kind of an invention is this you claim you are
      thinking up all the time?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I says, I would see myself telling you, wouldn't I and you blabbing
      it the next time a lot of them church women meets at our house and some
      old church deacon getting hold of it and getting rich off of it and me
      wandering the streets in destitution with the rain running down often my
      beard and the end of my nose because you and the children cast me into the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, she says, where is that thousand dollars that my uncle Lemuel willed
      to me and I give it to you for one of them inventions nearly thirty years
      ago and never seen hide nor hair on it since then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I says, that thousand dollars is gone and it went the same way as
      that money I loaned to your cousin Dan when he failed in business and
      would of starved to death him and his family if I hadn't come across with
      the cash that is where that thousand dollars is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that's the way it goes, until I get tired of trying to make her see
      any sense and sneak out to where my stuff is hid and fill me a pint bottle
      for my hip pocket and go and find a friend somewheres.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in just that way Prohibition is breaking up millions and millions of
      homes every day.

      the Old Soak, &ldquo;will soon be here. But me, I ain't going to look at it. I
      ain't got the heart to face it. I'm going to crawl off and make
      arrangements to go to sleep on the twenty-third of December and not wake
      up until the second of January.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them that is in favour of a denaturized Christmas won't be interfered
      with by me. I got no grudge against them. But I won't intrude any on them,
      either. They can pass through the holidays in an orgy of sobriety, and
      I'll be all alone in my own little room, with my memories and a case of
      Bourbon to bear me up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never could look on Christmas with the naked eye. It makes me so darned
      sad, Christmas does. There's the kids... I used to give 'em presents, and
      my tendency was to weep as I give them. 'Poor little rascals,' I said to
      myself, 'they think life is going to be just one Christmas tree after
      another, but it ain't.' And then I'd think of all the Christmases past I
      had spent with good friends, and how they was all gone, or on their way.
      And I'd think of all the poor folks on Christmas, and how the efforts made
      for them at that season was only a drop in the bucket to what they'd need
      the year around. And along about December twenty-third I always got so
      downhearted and sentimental and discouraged about the whole darned
      universe I nearly died with melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In years past, the remedy was at hand. A few drinks and I could look even
      Christmas in the face. A few more and I'd stand under the mistletoe and
      sing, 'God rest ye merry, gentlemen.' And by the night of Christmas day I
      had kidded myself into thinking I liked it, and wanted to keep it up for a
      week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this Christmas there ain't going to be any general iniquity used to
      season the grand religious festival with, except among a few of us Old
      Soaks that has it laid away. I ain't got the heart to look on all the
      melancholy critters that will be remembering the drinks they had last
      year. And I ain't going to trot my own feelings out and make 'em public,
      neither. No, sir. Me, I'm going to hibernate like a bear that goes to
      sleep with his thumb in his mouth. Only it won't be a thumb I have in my
      mouth. My house will be full of children and grandchildren, and there will
      be a passel of my wife's relations that has always boosted for
      Prohibition, but any of 'em ain't going to see the old man. I won't mingle
      in any of them debilitated festivities. I ain't any Old Scrooge, but I
      respect the memory of the old-time Christmas, and I'm going to have mine
      all by myself, the melancholy part of it that comes first, and the cure
      for the melancholy. This country ain't worthy to share in my kind of a
      Christmas, and I ain't so much as going to stick my head out of the window
      and let it smell my breath till after the holidays is over. I got presents
      for all of 'em, but none of 'em is to be allowed to open the old man's
      door and poke any presents into his room for him. They ain't worthy to
      give me presents, the people in general in this country ain't, and I won't
      take none from them. They might 'a' got together and stopped this
      Prohibition thing before it got such a start, but they didn't have the
      gumption. I've seceded, I have. And if any of my wife's Prohibition
      relations comes sniffin' and smellin' around my door, where I've locked
      myself in, I'll put a bullet through the door. You hear me! And I'll know
      who's sniffin', too, for I can tell a Prohibitionist sniff as fur as I can
      hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got a bar of my own all fixed up in my bedroom and there's going to be
      a hot water kettle near by it and a bowl of this here Tom and Jerry
      setting onto it as big as life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And every time I wake up I'll crawl out of bed and say to myself: 'Better
      have just one more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, now,' myself will say to me, 'just <i>one!</i> I really hadn't
      orter have that one; I've had so many&mdash;but just one goes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then we'll mix it right solemn and pour in the hot water, standing
      there in front of the bar, with our foot onto the railing, me and myself
      together, and myself will say to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, old scout, you better have another afore you go. It's gettin'
      right like holiday weather outside.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I hadn't really orter,' I will say to myself again, 'but it's a long
      time to next holidays, ain't it, old scout? And here's all the
      appurtenances of the season to you, and may it sing through your digestive
      ornaments like a Christmas carol. Another one, Ed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then I'll skip around behind the bar and play I was Ed, the
      bartender, and say, 'Are they too sweet for you, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then I'll play I was myself again and say, 'No, they ain't, Ed.
      They're just right. Ask that feller down by the end of the bar, Ed, to
      join us. I know him, but I forget his name.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then I'll play I was the feller and say I hadn't orter have another
      but I will, for it's always fair weather when good fellows gets together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then me and myself and that other feller will have three more,
      because each one of us wants to buy one, and then Ed the bartender will
      say to have one on the house. And then I'll go to sleep again and
      hibernate some more. And don't you call me out of that there room till
      along about noon on the second day of January. I'll be alone in there with
      my joy and my grief and all them memories.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER TEN&mdash;Continuing the History&mdash;the Old Soak Fears for the
      Growing Children
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NOTHER thing wrong
      with Prohibition that will one day make them sorry they passed that
      commandment onto the constitution is the way it will bring liquor in front
      of the growing children and if the children learns to drink it too young
      what will become of this country I would like to know when the next war
      comes along.
    </p>
    <p>
      I guess they didn't think of that, all these here wise Johnnies when they
      passed that law.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you used to get all you wanted in a barroom you went there for it and
      the children didn't see you and they couldn't go into them places and it
      wasn't sticking around under the children's noses at home all the time
      making them ask Pa what do you need with so much of that medicine and can
      I have some Pa.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now you have it at home and it is sticking under their noses all the
      time and the chances are millions and millions of children will learn to
      drink too soon just because it is sticking under their noses all the time
      and that is what Prohibition is doing for this country for everyone knows
      if they drink it too soon it will stunt their growths.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a great responsibility to bring up children right and Godfearing and
      be sure they say their lay me down to sleep every night like the Good Book
      says they should, and what I want to know is why this government don't
      help the parents and fathers with all them responsibilities instead of
      being a stumbling block in their way and putting liquor in the home where
      the growing children will smell it all the time and if they smell it they
      will want some of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course a young feller has got to learn to drink some time but there is
      such a thing as learning too young and it stunts their growth and the good
      book says keep it out of the mouths of babes and sucklings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe a little beer is all right if a baby is puny to fatten him up but I
      never give my children any hard liquor till they had their growth and I
      got no use for a government that turns in and puts liquor in the home to
      make drunkards out of the little innocent children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe if a child has got a cold a little whiskey is good for him and what
      is left in the bottom of the glass when their dad is done with it if they
      put some sugar and water in it and play they are like Pa won't hurt none
      of them any and will help make them so they can hold their share when they
      get growed up, but that is different from forcing it down their poor
      little innocent throats all the time and every day, which is what that
      Prohibition commandment amounts to.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knowed a child once in a fambly where they thought it was smart to let
      him have some hard liquor and he growed up with goggle eyes and all
      rickety from it and took to smoking these here cheap cigarettes and it was
      a shame as any person with any heart a tall would have said and does this
      government want the whole future generation of posterity to grow up goggle
      eyed and rickety like that by forcing liquor into the home and where will
      they get their strong soldiers from in the next war.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will say they got no conscience to do a thing like that to the whole
      passel of children waiting to grow up and go to be soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is enough to make any honest man stop and think and his heart bleed
      when he thinks of all them millions and millions of innocent children and
      the way they are being ruined with liquor in the home and maybe helping
      their daddies make it with yeast and raisins and things and cornmeal in
      the cellar.
    </p>
    <p>
      I teached my boys to drink in the barroom just as fast as they growed up
      and teached them to tell good liquor from bad liquor and not to mix their
      drinks and not to go in for fancy drinks and to drink along with me for a
      comfort for my old age and a father had ought to make chums of his boys
      like that and give them the right example and they stay close to him and
      he knows what they are thinking about and can give them good advice and my
      boys has been a comfort to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My boys is all growed up, but what worries me is the millions and millions
      of little children that is going to learn to drink too young.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, in my next chapter I promise to get down to brass tacks and tell
      just exactly what those barrooms was like that has been vanished.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER ELEVEN&mdash;Jabe Potter's Optimism
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>O, SIR,&rdquo; said the
      Old Soak, &ldquo;I ain't got so darned much left. It may get me through a year,
      and it may run me only about ten months.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't want so much as I use to, for some reason. In course, no
      gentleman of the old school figgers on less than a quart a day, but there
      has been times when I exceeded that there limit. Looking back on them
      times, I don't know whether to be glad or sorry. It's a satisfaction to
      remember that I had the liquor, but it's a grief to know I won't never
      have that same liquor again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But at a quart a day, if I'm careful, and don't give any parties to new
      acquaintances that is took sudden with a love and admiration for me, I'll
      toddle along fer ten or twelve months yet. And by that time, something or
      other will happen in my favour; you see if it don't. Either the country
      will backslide into iniquity again in spots; or else somebody will die and
      leave me an island down near Cuba; or else Old Jabe Potter, my friend out
      on Long Island I told you of, will get his smuggling works started into
      operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fact is, Old Jabe is already set, and his smuggling works is ready to
      operate right now, only there don't seem to be nothin' to smuggle, Jabe
      says. He's got one of these here gasolene boats, and he goes out and makes
      signals to the ocean liners to and from Europe, but they ain't onto Jabe's
      signals, or something. I tell him he's got to make arrangements in advance
      with some of them transatlantic bartenders, for they don't know what he's
      driving at. 'Well,' Jabe says, 'you'd think they could tell by my looks
      I'm thirsty, wouldn't you?' Jabe, he's romantic and optimistic; but them
      notions of his is all right if they was only organized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused a while, refreshed himself from his pocket flask, and then took
      up another line of enquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I would like to know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is what mean folks is going to
      blame their meanness onto, now that booze is gone. It used to be a good
      excuse for a lot of people that wasn't worth nothin', and knowed it, and
      acted ornery... booze was the answer, everybody said. If they did anything
      they hadn't orter, people said they was all right except when they had a
      drink or two, but a drink or two changed their entire disposition, and the
      drink orter be blamed, and not them. My own observation and belief leads
      me to remark that them kind of folks was less ornery and mean when they
      had booze than when they didn't have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I notice in myself a kind of a habit growing up to blame everything
      onto Prohibition, just as Prohibitionists used to blame everything onto
      booze. I want to be fair to the drys, and I will say that neither
      Prohibition nor booze has much to do with making a mean man mean. I want
      to be fair to the drys, so as to show them up; they ain't fair to me, and
      when I'm fair to them it shows how superior I be.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER TWELVE&mdash;More of the History&mdash;As It Used to Be of a
      Morning
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ELL, I promised I
      would tell just what those vanished barrooms was like, and I will tell the
      truth, so help me.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing that I can't get used to going without is that long brass
      railing where you would rest your feet, and I have got one of them fixed
      up in my own bedroom now so when I get tired setting down I can go and
      stand up and rest my feet one at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you would come in in the morning and you would say, Ed, I ain't
      feeling so good this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder what could the matter be, Ed says, though he has got a pretty
      good idea of what it could be all the time. But he's too kind hearted to
      let on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know, you says to Ed, I guess I am smoking too much lately. When
      you left here last night, Ed says, you seemed to be feeling all right,
      maybe what you got is a little touch of this here influenza.
    </p>
    <p>
      It ain't influenza, Ed, you says to him, it is them heavy cigars we was
      all smoking in here last night. I swallered too much of that smoke, Ed,
      and I got a headache this morning and my stomach feels kind o' like it was
      a democratic stomach all surrounded by republican voters, and a lot of
      that tobacco must of got into my eyes and I feel so rotten this morning
      that when my wife said are you going downtown without your breakfast I
      just said to her Hell and walked out to dodge a row because I could see
      she was bad tempered this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would you say to a little absinthe, says Ed, sympathetic and helpful,
      a cocktail or frappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, says you, if you was to say what I used to say, I leave that there
      stuff to these here young cigarettesmoking squirts, which it always tasted
      like paregoric to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, sir, Ed says, it is one of them foreign things, and how about a milk
      punch, it is sometimes soothing when a person has smoked too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Ed, you says, a milk punch is too much like vittles and I can't stand
      the idea of vittles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, sir, Ed used to say, you are right, sir, how about a gin fizz. A gin
      fizz will bring back your stomach to life right gradual, sir, and not with
      a shock like being raised from the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ed, you says to him, or leastways I always used to say, a silver fizz is
      too gentle, and one of them golden fizzes, with the yellow of an egg in
      it, has got the same objections as a milk punch, it is too much like
      vittles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, sir, Ed says, I think you are right about vittles. I can understand
      how you feel about not wanting vittles in the early part of the day. And
      that makes you love Ed, for you meet a lot of people who can't understand
      that. There ain't no sympathy and understanding left in the world since
      bartenders was abolished.
    </p>
    <p>
      How about an old-fashioned whiskey cocktail, says Ed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You feel he is getting nearer to it, and you tell him so, but it don't
      seem just like the right thing yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Ed sees you ain't never going to be satisfied with nothing till
      after it is into you and he takes the matter into his own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know what is the matter with you, he says, and what you want, and he
      mixes you up a whiskey sour and you get a little cross and say it helped
      some but there was too much sugar in it and not to put so much sugar in
      the next one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And by the time you drink the third one, somewhere away down deep inside
      of you there is a warm spot wakes up and kind of smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that is your soul has waked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you sort of wish you hadn't been so mean with your wife when you left
      home, and you look around and see a friend and have one with him and your
      soul says to you away down deep inside of you for all you know about them
      old Bible stories they may be true after all and maybe there is a God and
      kind of feel glad there may be one, and if your friend says let's go and
      have some breakfast you are surprised to find out you could eat an egg if
      it ain't too soft or ain't too done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I promised, so help me, I would tell the truth about them barrooms
      that has perished away, and the truth I will tell, and the truth with me
      used to be that more than likely it wasn't really cigars that used to get
      me feeling that way in the mornings, and I will take up a different part
      of the subject in my next chapter.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ROHIBITION,&rdquo; said
      the Old Soak, &ldquo;is doing more harm than you can see with the naked eye.
      Formerly when a man called up and told his wife that he was detained at
      his office by an unexpected caller on business just as he was starting
      home his wife knew he had stopped to take three or four balls with the
      boys on the corner and thought very little about it. Now she wonders if
      that unexpected caller could have been a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a man came home late with the smell of liquor on his breath he knew
      he was in bad, but he knew just how bad in he was. Now everything is
      uncertainty and guesswork everywhere, and intellects is cracking under
      strains on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must 'a' been the same way back in the historic days of iniquity and
      antiquity, when the Roman Empire switched all of a sudden from being
      heathen to being Christian; everybody had to be good all of a sudden, and
      only a few had learnt how; and everybody that hadn't quite succeeded in
      turning Christian went around for a while wondering if everybody else was
      as gosh-darned Christian as they let on to be. I know a lot of people now
      that says they're on the wagon, but I'd hate to go so sound asleep in a
      street car that I wouldn't wake up if they tried to pull my flask out of
      my pocket. I don't struggle none trying to be good, myself. I'm a
      dipsomaniac, and I know it, and I'm contented to be that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Years ago I used to struggle, and think maybe I would quit drinking some
      time, and it kept me unhappy. But as soon as I come right out and
      acknowledged Booze as my boss and master, and set him up and crowned him
      king, a great peace fell onto me, and I ceased to struggle, and I been
      happy and contented and full of love for my fellow men ever since. There
      ain't nothing like finding out which gang you belong to and sticking to
      your own crowd consistent. If I had only been brought up to be a drunkard
      when I was young I would 'a' settled into it natural and been saved a lot
      of worry and struggle and uncertainty. But there was years when I fit
      against it, from time to time, and it kept me unsettled and discontented,
      and I wasted a lot of good time trying to keep sober when I might 'a' been
      drunk and cheerful, radiating joy and happiness into the world and being
      of some use to my fellow men. But I s'pose everybody thinks if they had
      their life to live over again they'd do different, and the main thing is
      to reach peace and contentment toward the end, as I have reached it.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FOURTEEN&mdash;Continuing the History of the Rum Demon&mdash;Unfermented
      Grape Juice
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ELL, as I said in
      my last chapter, it is time for me to get down to brass tacks and describe
      just what those barrooms that has been vanished was like so that future
      generations of posterity will know what they missed, and to tell the truth
      in all particulars, so help me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of them was that arted up with hand paintings that if you had all
      them paintings in your home you would feel proud of yourself, like Solomon
      in all his glory, and would feel like you was living in the midst of a
      high art museum, and the shining brass cuspidores to spit in and the brass
      rail and all them shiny glasses and bottles and mirrors made up a scene of
      grandeur and glory like the good book mentions and you would think you was
      King Faro of Egypt, if you lived in the midst of all that or Job in all
      his riches before the itch broke out on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, speaking of the Good Book, my wife has always been more or less of a
      prohibitionist in order to show me that she is independent of me, and one
      day one of these here church friends of hers tries to tell me all the
      liquor that was drinked in the Bible wasn't nothing but unfermented grape
      juice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was, I said, don't you believe it was, like hell it was. You go
      and get your testament and see where King Solomon talks about the stuff
      that makes the heart merry and then go and swill yourself with grape juice
      and see if you could get the way he was when he wrote eat, drink, and be
      merry for tomorrow ye die. And how about the time them two women came to
      him with that one child and both claimed that it was hern and he says to
      the officer on duty, let me see that there sword of yourn for a minute
      I'll darned soon see who this kid belongs to. And verily the officer
      drawed his sword and the King he heaved it up and was about to cut the kid
      in two when one of the women says to stop unhand him King and not do the
      rash act it is the other woman's yew lamb and let her have it, it being
      her own all the time and her one yew lamb and her preferring to see the
      other woman grab it off than have half of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, says the King, half a loaf is better than no bread, but with infants
      it is different, take the child, it is yours woman, and go and sin no
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, now, I ask you, was King Solomon drinking the unfermented juice of
      the grape when he got that there hunch, or was he not? I will say he was
      not. Them radical and righteous ideas never come to a man when he is cold
      sober. He has got to have a shot of something moving around under his belt
      before he gets thataway.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how about them Bible hangovers, I said to this here church person. Man
      and boy I been a student of the Bible from cover to cover for a good many
      years now and I never seen a book with more evidences of hangovers and
      katzenjammers into it. How about that there book that says vanity, vanity,
      all is vanity. Well, I ask you, did you ever get that way in the morning
      after you had spent the night before drinking the unfermented juice of the
      grape.
    </p>
    <p>
      That there Book of Exclusiastics is just one long howl from the next
      morning head. Things seem right, says old Exclusiastic, and they look
      right; but if you bite into them they don't taste right, or words to that
      effect. And you stick around awhile, says old man Exclusiastic, and you'll
      darned soon see they ain't nothing right nowhere and never will be again.
      Moreover, says he, I was wrong when I used to think things was right;
      there ain't never anything anywhere been all right and I was all wrong
      when I was a young feller and used to think things was right and the
      wrongest thing about the whole business is the darned fools like I used to
      be who go around saying things is all right, and the sum and substance of
      everything is vanity, says he, vanity, vanity, all is vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      You could tell some folks that that there old Exclusiastic was writing as
      the result of unfermented grape juice, but a man with any experience of
      his own knows a good deal better and what kind of a taste was in his
      mouth. You can't tell an old Bible reader like me anything about this
      unfermented stuff. The trouble with these here church people is that too
      many of them ain't never read the Bible, or if they did read it they read
      it with the idea that it was saying something else like they wanted it to
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      I always stuck to the Bible in spite of the church folks and I always will
      for it has got some kick into it. There is three things in the world I
      always stick to, the Bible and hard liquor and calomel, for they has got
      the kick to them. You can have all your light wines and unfermented stuff
      and all your pretty new-thought religions and all your new-fangled
      medicines you want to, but for me I will stick to the Old Testament and
      corn whiskey and calomel like my forefathers done before me. You can't
      pull any of that unfermented stuff on me and get away with it.

      leave the old party flat on account o' rumours I hearn that this here Cox
      was comin' out for liquor. My conscience is Republican, but my religion is
      liquor; an' I would of voted agin any conscience fer the sake o' my
      religion. But I ain't goin' to be compelled fer to make that sacrifice.
      I'd ruther vote fer an outan'-out Prohibitionist than one of these here
      fellers that gits the word passed private to the wets that they'll be a
      stick in the lemonade, and gets the word passed private to the drys that
      what he means is nothin' but a stick o' pep'mint candy. They ain't no hope
      fer liquor in public life no more; it has become a question fer the home.
      As fur es my own private stock is concerned, it mostly ain't. But I got a
      grand idee workin' up. My old woman's got a niece who's come to live with
      us, an' I'm tryin' to marry that there gal to a revenue agent. I see by
      the papers they are always trackin' down a couple thousand gallons
      somewheres or other, and I don't hear no glass crashin' nowheres to
      indicate where them bottles is bein' busted. I wants somebody in the
      fambly that will take me along on some of these here raids I read about.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER SIXTEEN&mdash;The History Continued&mdash;Prohibition and Winter
      Weather
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ELL, when I seen
      all them men shovelling snow and ice in the streets and no place to go for
      a drink and maybe one of them spring thaws coming along soon now which
      they are always full of these here la grip germs I says to myself them
      Prohibitionists think they have done something pretty smart but they got
      another think coming to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never been much of a hand to kick against the weather. As a fact, I use
      to like all kinds of weather as it come along.
    </p>
    <p>
      You went into a place and you said to Ed it looks like one of them cold
      rains is going to start up pretty soon, Ed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, sir, Ed says, it is pretty raw. The wind is rawring. What will you
      have?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I use to say, I was wondering about a little Scotch with boiling
      water into it and a lump of butter and a lump of sugar into it I knowed a
      fellow used to treat himself thataway one time.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, sir, says Ed, I wouldn't advise anything like that sir, it will get
      you sweating inside of you all around your stomach and lungs and then you
      will go out and swallow some cold damp air and take one of them inside
      colds, sir, and it may run into new-monia or this here pellicanitis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Ed, I don't want to ketch none of them germs, you would say to him,
      and how about some rock and rye.
    </p>
    <p>
      You better stick to straight rye and leave out the rock. When you was in
      here a little bit ago you was drinking straight rye and you don't want to
      be mixing them too much, says Ed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And no sooner said than done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or maybe it was summer time and a hot day and you would say to Ed I wonder
      how many people is getting sun struck to-day, Ed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good many says Ed they drink too much cold water and it gets to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am glad I don't have to go out into the awful heat, you would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main thing is to keep your pores open says Ed for if you stop the
      presspiration that means a sun stroke. The main thing is to encourage the
      presspiration to sweat itself out of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think you are right Ed you says and I was wondering about some beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, sir, not for you, says Ed, I wouldn't advise no beer. You put these
      here temperance drinks like beer and sassperiller into your stomach, sir,
      and it takes up a lot of room you will wish you had later in the day. For
      some people I would say beer wouldn't do no harm, sir, but I should say,
      sir, that it was the wrong thing for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of them long silver fizzes with ice shook up into it would sound nice
      to my ears as it went down my oozlygoozlum you would say to Ed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ed he is kind of lazy with the heat and he don't want to shake it up so he
      says to you on a hot day like this you are taking chances with your life
      every time you put ice drinks into you and he says what's the matter with
      that rye you been drinking all the early part of the day that is the best
      thing to keep the presspiration coming out of your sweat pores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, no sooner said than done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of times them old-fashioned bartenders has saved my life summer
      and winter with good advice is as too numerous to mention as is the stars
      in the sky and their name is legend as the good book says.
    </p>
    <p>
      In them days when there was a barroom on every corner and sometimes four
      barrooms on every four corners I never cared about the weather at all for
      I knowed no matter what the weather was I could keep my health safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you was to look out the barroom window and see a sudden change in the
      weather you could make a sudden change and switch to some other kind of
      drink and keep yourself protected from them sudden changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in these days when a sudden change in the weather comes what
      protection have you got I would like to know. You are running the risks of
      them sudden changes all the time day and night, and no chance to change
      your drink to meet them with for you are lucky if you have one kind of
      liquor let alone all the different kinds of ingredients you used to
      ornament your digestion with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowadays when the weather ain't just right I have to stay home in my own
      room up to the top of the house where I got that little bar rigged up
      where I wait on myself and staying to home all the time ain't any too good
      for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It don't give me a chance to get any outdoor exercise, staying at home
      don't and a man needs outdoor exercise if he is going to keep his health.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is another thing Prohibition has done to me: it has took away all my
      chance for outdoor exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reckon them Prohibitionists will be satisfied when they got everybody's
      health broke down on account of them sudden changes in the weather and
      nobody getting any outdoor exercise any more.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NOTHER thing I
      miss in regard to all them vanished barrooms being closed up is kind
      feeling about respect to the old especially to parents and them that has
      departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where is the younger generations of posterity going to learn how to be
      kind hearted about home and mother now that the barrooms is all closed up
      I would like to know?
    </p>
    <p>
      It used to be that a lot of fellows would get all tanked up of an
      afternoon or evening and in the right sort of a place they would get to
      singing songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      All them songs about home and mother and to treat her right now that her
      hair had turned gray. I never was much of a one to sing myself especially
      unless I had a few drinks into me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But whether I helped sing them or not all them songs would make a better
      man of me. You stand up to a bar or sit down at a table and listen to them
      songs for two or three hours and if you are any kind of a man at all you
      will wish you had always done the right thing and now that all them songs
      about home and mother has been took away from me I ain't the man I used to
      be at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel myself going down hill because my softer emotions and feelings
      ain't never stirred up by nothing any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, this Eighteenth Commandment is going to make a hard-hearted country
      out of this here country. Nobody is never going to think as much of home
      and mother as they used to. And I guess them prohibitionists won't feel so
      smart when they see all them old ladies with gray hair flung out onto the
      streets in the rainy weather just because nobody would pay the mortgage
      off. Lots of times when I was a young feller after hearing them songs for
      awhile I would say to myself I will set right down and write a letter to
      my mother, I ain't wrote her for five or six months. And when I got older
      after she passed on I used to say to myself some of these days I will have
      to make a visit to the old home place and take a look around there.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all them softer feelings has been took away from me now and what I
      would like to know is how is the younger generation going to grow up. Hard
      hearted, that is how.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these here fine days I may be cast out into the street myself with
      the rain drops dripping down offen my hat brim into my eyebrows just
      because nobody won't pay a mortgage and it has got to be a hard-hearted
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope none of them there smart alick Prohis will be flung out onto the
      street thataway. Because they got no friends would pay off their mortgages
      and they would just naturally be destituted to death. I ain't hard hearted
      like they be and I hope that don't happen to none of them. But if it ever
      did they would find out a few things.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my next chapter I will get down to brass tacks and give a true
      description of them barrooms that has perished off the face of the earth.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Old Soak has
      been looking rather well for some time; he seems prosperous and happy, for
      the most part, and contented with the quantity and quality of the hootch
      he has been gettin'. But yesterday he dropped in to see us with just the
      slightest shade of gloom on his features. We asked him about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's that there son of mine,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;He's too young to know enough to
      let well enough alone, like the Good Book says to do. They's a lot of
      these young fellers you can't learn nothing to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This yere son-in-lawr of mine I been tellin' you about, that is a
      revenooer, got my son made into a revenooer, too. And it ain't long before
      my son gits jest as good an automobile as the one my son-in-lawr's been
      drivin'. And joy out to our house has been unconcerned, with everyone
      exceptin' the Ol' Woman, and she's been prayin' agin the rest of the
      fambly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this yere son o' mine, he gets too much hootch under his belt one
      day, and he gets into this yere brand-new automobile of his'n and he
      starts onto one of these yere raids. Which would of been all right, bein'
      as it's what a revenooer is for, if he had only used a leetle bit o'
      jedgment. But the young has got a lot to learn, and babes and striplings,
      the Good Book says, jest naturally has their dam fool streaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This yere raid my son goes onto turns out all wrong. For whilst he is
      pinchin' who does he pinch in the gang of wicked sinners but that there
      son-in-lawr of mine, the revenooer as got him his job, said son-in-lawr
      bein' off duty and pickled hisself at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this here son-in-lawr of mine, he mighty nigh loses of his job as a
      revenooer, bein' took up in one of the raids he was legally supposed to be
      startin' himself, and they was quite a fuss about it, so I understand, and
      the thing was finally settled with a compromise&mdash;it wasn't my
      son-in-lawr lost his job, but they compromised it and fired my son out'n
      his job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now my son, he has went and got sore at my son-in-lawr, and he says
      unless he gits his job back as a revernooer he will tell all he knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So my house is a house that is sided against itself, like the Good Book
      says, and every member of the fambly has took sides one way or the other
      'twixt my son and my son-in-lawr, and the Ol' Woman is agin both on 'em,
      and agin me, too&mdash;a-prayin' an' a-prayin' an' a-prayin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You went and prayed for years an' years so as to get prohibish'n,' I
      tells her; 'an' now you got it&mdash;you got more on it than any woman I
      knows, for it's come right into your own home. An' now you got it you
      ain't satisfied with it&mdash;there you be onto your marrow bones prayin'
      agin the revenooers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s'pose I was too hifalutin' an' ambitious, wantin' to keep two members
      of my fambly into the revenooer job. And as long as my son-in-lawr stays
      into office and continues to make his home with me I won't have no kick
      cornin', but will take my hootch in thankfulness and humility, like the
      Good Book says to do, eatin', drinkin' an' bein' merry. This yere leetle
      cloud of gloom what you notice is due to the Ol' Woman's prayers. I cain't
      help but feel she is goin' direct agin Scripter and her husband's best

      those barrooms that has been vanished forever is the fact that most of
      them was right polite sort of places if a fellow edged up to the bar and
      knocked over your glass of whiskey or something like that he would say, O
      excuse me stranger and you would say sure, but look where in hell you are
      going to after this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure he would say no offence meant. No offence taken you would say to him.
      Have one with me he would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner said than done.
    </p>
    <p>
      But nowadays all you see and hear is bad manners and impoliteness with
      people hustling and bumping into each other on the subways and stepping on
      each other and women and children amongst them and nobody ever begging
      anybody's pardon and hard feelings everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trouble is everybody is sore and wanting a drink all the time and
      there is no place where the younger generation is going to learn good
      manners now that the barrooms is gone. What is the young fellows just
      growing up to manhood going to do for their manners now that the barrooms
      is closed, is what I want to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      It used to be you would get onto a subway train and there would be two or
      three women standing up and you would be setting down and there would be
      three or four drinks under your belt and you would be feeling good and you
      would say to yourself am I a gentleman or ain't I a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're damned right I am a gentleman, you would say to yourself, here,
      lady, you set down, and don't let any of these here bums roust you out of
      that seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any of these here bums tries to roust you out of that seat I will put a
      tin ear onto them.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's the kind of a gentleman I am, lady, they would have a hell of a
      time, lady, getting your seat away from you with me here.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she seen you was a gentleman and she smiled at you and you hung onto a
      strap and felt good.
    </p>
    <p>
      But nowadays there ain't no manners, with no place to get a drink or
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are setting in the subway and a lady comes in and has nowheres to set,
      and you say to yourself let some of these other guys get up and give her a
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you think a while and you say to yourself I'll bet she is a
      Prohibitionist anyhow. Let her stand up. She has got to learn you can't
      have any manners with the barrooms all closed and everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that's another thing closing the barroom has done. It has took away
      all the manners this town ever had.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my next chapter I will get down to brass tacks and tell just what those
      barrooms was like for the benefit of future posterity that has never seen
      one.

      CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE&mdash;Sympathy Wanted
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>ES,&rdquo; said the Old
      Soak, &ldquo;I get plenty of hootch nowadays. My son is back into the revenoo
      business, and my son-in-lawr is with it, too. I gets plenty of whiskey.
      I've got some into me, and I've got some onto my hip, and I know where I'm
      going to get some more when that's gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so gloomy, then?&rdquo; we asked. &ldquo;You should be radiating a Falstaffian
      joviality. You should be as merry as the merry, merry villagers in an
      opera on the Duke's birthday. But on the contrary, you shake from out your
      condor wings unutterable wo, as E. A. Poe has it. Wherefore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I miss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the next mornin' sympathy... the next mornin'
      ministration. Any one can get drunk under the auspices of Prohibition, but
      it takes the right kind of barkeep fur to get you sober agin and make you
      like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the next morning barkeep? He ain't. He was wise as a serpent and
      gentle as a dove like the Good Book says. He knowed right off what ailed
      you, at 11 o'clock on a cloudy morning, and what was good for it. A little
      of this, out of the long green bottle, and a little of that, and some ice
      tinklin' in it, and the white of an egg mebby, and... oh, you know! One of
      them, and there was salve onto the sore spot of your soul. Two of them and
      you began to forgive yourself. Three of them, and you could hear about
      breakfast; you could look an egg into the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he never asked no question about your past, that barkeep didn't. He
      didn't need to. He knowed. He seen last night's history in this morning's
      footnote. He was kind. 'Feel a little better now, sir?' he'd ask. 'Two or
      three of them is enough, sir, if you ask me. Get your breakfast, now, sir,
      and you'll be quite O. K. Yes, sir, I learned to mix them in New
      Orleans...' You talked to him, and he let you. He was like a mother's knee
      to a three-year-old that's bumped his head, the old-fashioned barkeep was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now, he ain't. Now, when you get up, Gloom stands on one side of you
      and Conscience on the other, and Remorse is feeding lines of both of 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well,' says Gloom, 'this is a fine, cheerful morning, this is! This is
      about as full of sunshine as the insides of the whale that drank Jonah.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It is,' says Remorse, 'and then some. Conscience and me feels so bad
      about it that we're gonna jump off the dock together.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I ain't, neither,' says Conscience. 'I'm gonna save myself for the
      worst. The worst is yet to come. And I want to be here when it comes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I ain't gonna be here when it comes,' says Gloom. 'I'm going over to the
      Aquarium and rent myself out for a fish.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just then,&rdquo; went on the Old Soak, &ldquo;a strange party sticks his head in at
      the door and says, 'Never again!' &ldquo;'Who be you?' says Gloom. 'I'm
      Repentance,' says the buttinski, 'and I calls on you guys to mend your
      ways!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Gloom, he looks at the hard liquor left in the bottom of the bottle,
      and at the sky, and at the door of the closed-up barroom across the
      street, and he says, 'It can't be done without some uplift. I need
      soothing words, and an educated hand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'We got what's coming to us,' says Remorse. 'And there's more of it
      coming,' says Conscience. 'Better quit!' says Repentance. 'I ain't gonna
      quit,' says Gloom, 'without the right kind of a drink to quit on. I ain't
      never yet quit without the right kind of a drink to quit on, and I'm not
      going to start any innovations on a rotten day like this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; went on the Old Soak, &ldquo;you sits on the edge of your bed and you
      listen to these yere guys talking, and you think how right all of them is,
      and you wonder whether it's any use getting up, and you think of all the
      barkeeps you used to know, and after a while you suck an orange and think
      of one of them long silver fizzes with frost on the glass and charity and
      loving-kindness in its heart, like Ed used to shake up,&mdash;you think of
      it so hard you well-nigh taste it, and then the meerage fades away and you
      ain't nothin' but a camel in the desert again with a humpbacked taste in
      your mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the Old Soak, &ldquo;I can get all the booze I want, but I
      can't get sympathy. What a man needs in the morning is a kind heart for to
      comfort him, and a strong arm to lean on. Anybody can give me good advice,
      but it don't soothe me any; what I want is a quick friend in a white
      apron, wise as a bishop and gentle as a nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I want is the Al's and Ed's I used to know. But they've went.
      Forever. I won't meet 'em in Hell, because they're too kind hearted to go
      there, and I won't meet 'em in Heaven, because I won't go there myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; concluded the Old Soak, &ldquo;I'll have to go to England.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO&mdash;The History of the Rum Demon Concluded&mdash;Prohibition
      Is Making a Free Thinker of the Old Soak
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NOTHER thing that
      going without barrooms is doing for this country is it is destroying Home
      Life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is pretty hard to get along with your wife after you have been married
      to her for twenty or thirty years and kind of settle down and realize you
      are going to be married to her as long as she lives for better or for
      worse unless something happens which it seldom does.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that you don't kind of like her and you know she kind of likes you but
      the thing is that her and you is apt to treat each other mean now and then
      because you get to thinking what a good time you could have if you didn't
      have to turn in so much of your money to making a home run smooth and you
      know even if you do row with each other you will make up again and you get
      to kind of looking forward to the rows because anyhow that is a change.
    </p>
    <p>
      But sometimes you carry them rows too far and then you don't know how to
      get your Home Life running right again because she is always too stubborn
      to give in and you won't be the first one to give in because you know she
      is wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when there was liquor to be had in plenty it was easier to make up
      after one of them rows and Home Life went along smoother.
    </p>
    <p>
      You would get up in the morning and she would say to you, would you have a
      boiled egg for breakfast or a fried, and you would say hades what an idea.
      Can't you never think of anything but eggs for breakfast. And she would
      say yesterday I didn't have eggs and you was sore because you wanted eggs.
      You would say just because I wanted eggs yesterday is that any sign I want
      them every day of my life till death do us part. I was only asking what
      you wanted she would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will go where I can get what I want, you would say. I will eat my
      breakfast at a restaurant this morning and maybe I can keep them from
      shoving eggs in front of me when I don't ask for eggs. The trouble with
      your stomach is not what you put into it in the morning, she would say,
      but what you put into it the night before. The trouble with my stomach,
      you would say, is that I am worried to death and worked to death all the
      time trying to keep this house running and it gives me the dis-pepsy. It
      is the liquor gives you dispepsy she would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it wasn't for a little stimulant in my stomach, like the Good Book
      says, you tell her, my dispepsy wouldn't let me digest anything at all and
      I would starve to death and the mortgage on the house would be foreclosed
      and you would go to the old woman's home. Whose money pays the interest on
      that mortgage she would say. Whose? you would say. Mine, she would say.
      You wouldn't have any money you tell her, if you paid me back what your
      relations has borrowed of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, one word leads to another, and you go off without any breakfast, for
      you see her taking the Bible down to set and read it, and when she sets
      and reads the Bible you know she is reading it against you and it gets you
      madder and madder.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the old days when there was barrooms you would go into one still
      feeling mad and say Ed, mix me one of the old-fashioned whiskey cocktails
      and don't put too much orange and that kind of damned garbage into it, I
      want the kick.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner said than done.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after a couple of them you would say, well after all, the Old Woman
      means well, I wonder if I didn't treat her a little mean this morning I
      orter call her up on the telephone and give her a jolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then you would think of her relations that you hate and get mad at her
      again on account of always sticking up for them, and say, Ed, that don't
      set so well, let's try a whiskey sour.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you would meet a friend and have another with him, and pretty soon eat
      some breakfast and think how, after all, it was eggs you was eating for
      breakfast and they wasn't cooked no ways as good as the old woman would of
      poached them for you on toast if you hadn't been so darned mean to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And your friend would say his old woman blowed him up for coming home
      pickled.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you would have another drink and say that was one thing your old woman
      never done to you. My old woman has got some sense, you would say to him,
      she knows how a man feels about taking a drink, and she never blows me up.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you would set and brag about your old woman and you had never had a
      cross word between you in thirty years. And then he would begin to brag
      about his old woman, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      And pretty soon you would say to yourself you better go to the phone and
      call her up. She has her mean streaks all right, but who knows, she may
      have been right this morning after all, and you take another drink and get
      her on the telephone, and give her a chance to say how sorry she was about
      the way she treated you that morning and maybe you go and pay an
      installment on a new carpet sweeper for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it was that way in the old days. Liquor kept your Home Life running
      along o. k. You would get mad with your wife and then you would get sorry
      for her and give her an excuse to make up with you again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, with no chance to get a drink when I am away from home if I treat
      the Old Woman mean in the morning I don't give her a chance to get on my
      good side again. And I can see sometimes that it is breaking her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's what prohibition is doing to this country. It is breaking the
      women's hearts and it is breaking up the Home Life on every hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is going to become of a country where all the Home Life is broke up?
    </p>
    <p>
      And what is going to become of the children if there ain't any Home Life
      running along smooth any more?
    </p>
    <p>
      These Prohibitionists that is so darned smart never thought of that I
      guess when they put that Eighteenth Commandment across onto us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever I think of all them women's hearts that is breaking and all that
      Home Life that is going plumb to the dogs all on account of the barrooms
      being closed up it well-nigh makes a free thinker out of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't claim to be a church man, but I never was a free thinker before,
      neither. But all the sorrow that is going on in the world on account of
      them barrooms being closed is making a free thinker of me.

     The mellow dusks, the friendly dusks and dim,
     When Charley shook the cocktails up, or Tim&mdash;?
     Gone are ten thousand gleaming moments, gone
     Like fireflies twinkling toward oblivion!
     Ah, how the bubbles used to leap and swim,
     Breaking in laughter round the goblet's brim,
     When Walter pulled a cork for us, or John!
     I have seen ghosts of men I never knew,&mdash;
     Great, gracious souls, the golden hearts of earth&mdash;
     Look from the shadows in those rooms we love,
     Living a wistful instant in our mirth;
     I have seen Jefferson smile down at Drew,
     And Booth pause, musing, on the stair above.

    <h2>
      V&mdash;A TEMPERANCE TRACT
    </h2>
    <p>
      To Bob Dean
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Cocktails are the little brooms
     That whiskey way your will-power!
     A dark disease is Bright's disease,
     And will not yield to pill-power.
     Some may upon red rums descant
     Who never did decant rums,
     But I have eaten bitter bread
     Where bitters breed their tantrums.
     The fool will give his life to booze,
     The wiser man taboos that,
     And I'm a sad Budweiser man
     Than when I used to ooze that.
     I owned a bank, and for a fad
     I cultivated two lips;
     If I had owned the mint itself
     'Twould all have gone for juleps.
     Mumm's extra dry makes some men grow
     As dry as any mummy,
     But when I'm tight I loosen up&mdash;
     A punch, and I am chummy.
     Except when I swore off in Lent
     With borrowers I mingled;
     They'd make my pockets cease to clink
     Whenever I was jingled.
     But though I drank with scarce a check
     My drafts saved people trouble,
     For I would often pay dubs twice
     Because I saw 'em double.
     O, cognac is a fearful drink
     To brandy man with shame, O!
     He will, that drinks diluted gin,
     Die looted of good name, O!
     I wined till I began to ail,
     And then I whined with aleing,
     Until to crown the woes I cite
     I found my eyesight failing.
     &ldquo;Sir, fits will come,&rdquo; my doctor warned,
     &ldquo;Surfeits will bloat the mind, sir!&rdquo;
      I laughed and took my glasses off
     And said, &ldquo;I'll go it blind, sir!&rdquo;
      Champagnes and real incider me
     Set my high spirits flagon;
     Still with gay dogs I played the wag,
     Deriding of the wagon.
     My tongue was like a cotton bale,
     All whitish from the gin, sir&mdash;
     The doctor said &ldquo;No tongue can state
     The state your tongue is in, sir!&rdquo;
      &ldquo;With so much rye and corn you cope,
     Your crowd are cornucopers&mdash;
     How can earth be Utopia
     When peopled by you topers?&rdquo;
      But still I dodged from fête to fête,
     Still followed by my fate, O!
     Still floating loans and liquids till
     My bank did liquidate, O!
     Buns use up dough; what my fun did,
     Were it refunded one day,
     Would fund the Banks of Newfoundland
     And float the Bay of Fundy.
     Don't hitch your wagon to a star
     Upon the brandy bottle;
     If you your neck to nectar ope
     Your hope 'twill surely throttle.

      VI&mdash;A VISION IN THE NIGHT

      To Grant Rice
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Beyond Arcturus, in a peevish wind,
     I met a rumpled devil beating home.
     &ldquo;And whence, poor Fiend,&rdquo; I challenged, &ldquo;hast
         thou come
     With ragged plumage ravelled out behind
     And splintered teeth and lamps all blear and blind?
     What Fate hath bent a skillet o'er thy dome?&rdquo;
      He sighed, and in that sigh I read a tome
     Of bleeding sorrows and
          an aching mind.
     &ldquo;Rough Stuff,&rdquo; he moaned, &ldquo;was what I got for
          mine!
     It was fierce Virtue put me on the bum,
     Trampled my slats and wronged my winsome face&mdash;
     Once I was loved and called the Angel Wine!

     I am known only as the Demon Rum!&rdquo;

      VII&mdash;THE LAST CASE OF GIN

    <p>
      To Loren Palmer
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The Tullywub is singing by the Willywinkle's grotto
     His passionate devotion, though he knows he hadn't
          ought to,
     And she wipes away a teardrop with a little furtive
          fin;
     She is fluttered, but she's frightened by his outburst
          of emotion
     In their somewhat formal corner of a rather proper
          ocean&mdash;
     And I can understand 'em, for I've got a crate of gin.
     Interpretative theses on the psychochemic state
     Induced in the batrachia by fear or love or hate
     I find are rather easy since I've opened up the crate,
     And I'm gonna be a scientist by morning.
     A Willywinkle's seldom a sprightly thing or elfish,
     But morally she's rigid as the most exclusive shell-
           fish;

     She cans her rash admirer, but she cans him with a
          sigh!
     An analytic novel might be reared upon the basis
     Of a very earnest study of the looks upon their
          faces
     And their brave renunciation when they sobbed and
          said good-by.
     I claim that the transmission of their fortitude and
          pain
     To succeeding generations will improve the moral
          strain
     Of the species here considered and their loss result
          in gain;
     And I wish I had some Angostura Bitters!
     I have a strong impression of the immanence of
           morals
     In this quite extensive cosmos, from castor beans
          to corals,
     And Science and Religion, I will tell the world, are
     one;
     I should prove it, gentle reader, had we leisure time
           before us,
     I should prove it or expire in the act of hurling
           Taurus&mdash;
     I wonder where the dickens has that silly corkscrew
           gone?
     I find, as I grow older, the pert Subliminal
     Keeps butting in to chatter with egoistic gall:
     Romance I meditated; this isn't that at all&mdash;
     But anyhow I have some limes and siphons!

     Down in a wine vault underneath the city
     Two old men were sitting; they were drinking
          booze.
     Torn were their garments, hair and beards were gritty;
     One had an overcoat but hardly any shoes.
     Overhead the street cars through the streets were
          running
     Filled with happy people going home to Christmas;
     In the Adirondacks the hunters all were gunning,
     Big ships were sailing down by the Isthmus.
     In came a Little Tot for to kiss her granny,
     Such a little totty she could scarcely tottle,
     Saying, &ldquo;Kiss me, Grandpa! Kiss your little Nanny!&rdquo;
      But the old man beaned her with a whiskey bottle!
     Outside the snowflakes began for to flutter,
     Far at sea the ships were sailing with the seamen,
     Not another word did Angel Nanny utter.
     Her grandsire chuckled and pledged the Whiskey
          Demon!
     Up spake the second man; he was worn and weary,
     Tears washed his face, which otherwise was pasty;
     &ldquo;She loved her parents, who commuted on the Erie;
     Brother, I'm afraid you struck a trifle hasty!
     &ldquo;She came to see you, all her pretty duds on,
     Bringing Christmas posies from her mother's
           garden,
     Riding in the tunnel underneath the Hudson;
     Brother, was it Rum caused your heart to harden?&rdquo;
      Up spake the first man, &ldquo;Here I sits a thinking
     How the country's drifting to a sad condition;
     Here I sits a dreaming, here I sits a drinking,
     Here I sits a dreading, dreading prohibition,
     &ldquo;When in comes Nanny, my little daughter's
           daughter;
     Me she has been begging ever since October
     For to sign the pledge! It's ended now in slaughter&mdash;
     I never had the courage when she caught me sober!
     &ldquo;All around the world little tots are begging
     Grandpas and daddies for to quit their lushing.
     Reformers eggs 'em on. I am tired of egging!
     Tired of being cowed, cowering and blushing!
     &ldquo;I struck for freedom! I'm a man of mettle!
     Though I never would 'a' done it had I not been
          drinking&mdash;
     From Athabasca south to Popocatapetl
     We must strike for freedom, quit our shrinking!&rdquo;
      Said the second old man, &ldquo;I beg your pardon!
     Brother, please forgive me, my words were hasty!
     I get your viewpoint, our hearts must harden!
     Try this ale, it is bitter, brown and tasty.&rdquo;
      Said the first old man, &ldquo;Hear me sobbing.
     &ldquo;Poor little Nanny, she's gone to Himmel.
     Principle must conquer, though hearts be throbbing!
     Just curl your lip around this kimmel!&rdquo;
      Down in a wine vault underneath the city
     They sat drinking while the snow was falling,
     Wicked old men with scarcely any pity&mdash;
     The moral of my tale is quite appalling!

     Sometimes it leaps to clutch the curb

     Out of my forehead now the long thoughts reach
     In level rays that melt the Pleiades,
     Which, melting, somehow smell like toasted
          cheese . . .
     I know Life's secret now, but have no speech
     To utter it: indeed, small wish to teach
     My truths to trivial planets such as these
     Whereon the populations drone like bees
     That have no honey-gift, each stinging each . . .
     And yet I will speak, too!... the slow words
          come
     With pain out of my deeps of ecstasy,
     Burst from my soul as from a beaten drum
     In a hoarse pulse of sound . . . But hark to
          me!
     &ldquo;Life's secret is that all things cool somewhat
     Like golden bucks&rdquo;...but, somehow, that
          seems rot.

     You go through Shelley Lane, striking your staff

     You, Christopher, and we shall quarrel and quaff
     Our pewter tankards full of Shandygaff,

     And must we die first? Well, it's worth the trouble
     I shall go first, because I'm old and gray,

      XVII&mdash;THE BATTLE OF THE KEYHOLES
    </h2>
    <p>
      To Jimmy Farnsworth
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The keyholes to the right of me
     Were dancing of a jig,
     The keyholes to the left of me
     Were merry as a grig,
     The keyholes right before my face
     Were drunk and winked at me,
     And I stood there alone&mdash;alone!&mdash;
     With one
     small
     key.

     They frightened me, they daunted me;
     I turned back to the stair,
     And faced nine keyholes pale and stern
     That lay in ambush there.
     Six keyholes on the ceiling sat,
     Eight keyholes on the door,
     And seven saddened keyholes lay
     Hiccoughing
     on the
     floor.

     I crawled through one, I crawled through two,
     I crawled through keyholes three&mdash;
     And then I saw a vistaed mile
     Of keyholes waiting me!&mdash;
     &ldquo;I will not crawl another yard
     Through keyholes, though I die!&rdquo;&mdash;
     Oh, when my fighting blood is up
     A Turk
     am.

     They leapt at me, they flew at me,
     They whistled as they came,
     They gritted of their gleaming teeth,
     They stung and spurted flame;
     I put my back against the floor
     And fought 'em gallantly&mdash;?
     But what could anybody do
     With one
     small
     key?

     Keyholes at the front of me,
     And keyholes on the flank,
     And as they rushed at me I smelled
     The liquor that they drank;
     Keyholes on my spinal cord,
     And keyholes in my hair&mdash;
     And with a &ldquo;Heave together, boys!&rdquo;
      They rolled
     me down
     the stair.

     It bumped me some, it bent me some,
     It broke a nose or two,
     And when the milkman came, he said:
     &ldquo;What Kaiser Belgiumed you?&rdquo;
      I says to him: &ldquo;It might have been
     The same with you as me
     If you like me had had to fight
     A gang of keyholes all last night
     With one
     small
     key!&rdquo;

     I thought a Sun pursued; through endless space

     My hide caught fire and crackled with the pace,
     My burning heart with jets of anguish beat;
     Flaming I leapt, in flame leapt on the fleet
     And savage star . . .  We slashed our fiery trace
     Ten constellations broad in screaming red
     Across the startled purple of the night;
     A word tremendous clove mine ears and head,
     A great arm fell and stripped my wings of flight:
     &ldquo;Hey, Mister, pay your check!&rdquo; a brute voice said.
     It was a red-haired barkeep known as Ed.

     Some fools keep ringing the dumb waiter bell

     &ldquo;This is a pretty time to bring the ice!&rdquo;
      &mdash;Old Uncle Ned! Two times of late, or thrice,

     My way of life can end in nothing good!
     At Mrs. Dumple's, last week, when I fell
     And spoiled her dinner party I was led
     Out to a cab; they saw I was not well
     And took me home and tucked me into bed.
     I should quit mingling hashish with my rice!
     I should give over singing &ldquo;Three Blind Mice&rdquo;

     That none but he can see? Why should one dwell

     Zoo-ward I lured to see the cobras fed;&mdash;
     &ldquo;We can't get home,&rdquo; I giggled, &ldquo;for the El
     Is broken, Sarah&mdash;let's elope, instead!&rdquo;
      I spoke of all she'd have to sacrifice,
     And she seemed yielding to me, once or twice,
     Until my wife broke in and said: &ldquo;Eugene,
     Your finger nails are seldom really clean;&mdash;
     I'd loose poor Sarah's hand, Eugene, I would!&rdquo;
      How weak and stupid I have always been!
     My way of life can end in nothing good.
     I drink and doze and wake and think of hell,
     My eyes are blear from all the tears I shed:
     I'm pitiably bald: I'm but a shell!
     I sobbed to-day, &ldquo;I wish that I were dead!&rdquo;
      I wish I could quit drugs and drink and dice.
     I wish I had not talked of chicken lice
     The Sunday that we entertained the Dean,
     Nor shouted to his wife that paraffin
     Would make her thin beard grow, nor played the
          food
     Was pennies and her face a slot machine:
     My way of life can end in nothing good.
     &mdash;That bell again: A voice: &ldquo;Is your name Bryce?
     These goods is C. O. D. Send down the price!&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Bryce lives,&rdquo; I yell, &ldquo;at Number Seventeen!&rdquo;
      Bryce doesn't live there, but I feel so mean
     I laugh and lie; my tone is harsh and rude.
     &mdash;Uncle is gone! I'm phthisical and lean&mdash;

     A young man in a Mu-se-um
     Was showing me a mummy
     Who lay there patiently, but glum,
     A-clasping of his tummy. . .
     Cophetua or Kafoozelum,
     Or some such regal rummy.
     &ldquo;In youth,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;this king was gay,
     In spite of Mrs. Grundy;
     He burnt the Nile one Saturday,

     But where was he on Sunday?&rdquo;
      I added, in my learned way,
     &ldquo;'Sic transit gloria mundi!'
     &ldquo;He conquered princes not a few;
     They voted as he bid 'em.
     From Babylon to Timbuctoo,
     From Sheba up to Siddim,
     He thought of things he shouldn't do,
     And then he went and did 'em!
     &ldquo;He loved to send out royal bids
     For high Egyptian jinkses
     Where pretty Theban katydids
     And little Memphian minxes
     Would trot among the pyramids
     And tango round the sphinxes . . .
     &ldquo;But now, in his sarcophagus,
     How quite deceased we find him,
     With sand in his aesophagus
     And all his past behind him,
     While Time (the anthropophagus!)
     Is whetting teeth to grind him.
     &ldquo;Then note, my lad, the end of kings!
     Therefore, avoid ambition,
     For earthly greatness all has wings.
     You stick to your position,
     And if men come with crowns and things
     To tempt you, go a-fishin'!&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Was I a Kingly Souse,&rdquo; says he,
     Impressed from A to Izzard,
     &ldquo;Would I wind up so leathery
     As this departed wizard,
     With baldness on the dome of me,
     And gravel in my gizzard?&rdquo;
      &ldquo;You would without a doubt,&rdquo; says I,
     &ldquo;Lose wealth and health and hair, O!&rdquo;
      Shaken with sobs he made reply,
     &ldquo;I promise, and I swear, O!
     That I will never drink!&mdash;and try
     And never be a Pharaoh!&rdquo;

      XXIX&mdash;A KANSAS TRAGEDY
    </h2>
    <p>
      To Charley Stansbury
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     I started from Missouri,
     The western part of Missouri,
     To ride to Nicodemus,
     To Nicodemus, Kansas,
     In the western part of Kansas;
     Not far from Happy, Kansas,
     In Graham County, Kansas . . .
     Across the State of Kansas I started in a flivver . . .
     A jolty little flivver with a rhythm rather jerky . . .
     Irregularly rhythmical, when rhythmical at all . . .
     I had to get to Nicodemus
     By noon on Saturday to pay the mortgage
     On a farm near Nicodemus,
     Graham County, Kansas,
     Belonging to a sweetheart who would otherwise be
          rooned
     Financially and so could not afford to marry me. . . .
     As I entered into Kansas,
     And crossed Miami County,
     At the town of Ossawatomie
     I received a telegraphic message
     From my love at Nicodemus.
     &ldquo;Hasten with the money,&rdquo; said the telegraphic
          message,
     &ldquo;Hasten with the money you are bringing from my
          Uncle.
     From my Uncle Jethro, in Missouri,
     For the man that holds the mortgage,
     Banker Jasper Grinder, who holds the fiendish
     mortgage,
     Has said he will foreclose it
     And take away the homestead at noon on Saturday,
     Or else I'll have to marry him,
     To keep him from foreclosing,
     Marry Banker Jasper Grinder to keep him from
     foreclosing . . .
     I would hate to marry Grinder,
     But, on the other hand,
     I would hate to lose the whole alfalfa crop .  .  .
     Hasten with the money,
     From my Uncle Jethro,
     Hasten to your true love, Miss Elvira Simpkins,
     At Nicodemus, Kansas.&rdquo;
      Three hundred miles away
     Was Nicodemus, Kansas,
     Nicodemus, Graham County,
     Not so far from Happy, Kansas
     Could I do it in a flivver
     In ten hours?
     from Ossawatomie I started with a burst of speed,
     That carried me to Quenemo,
     To Quenemo, in Osage County, Kansas,
     At the rate of forty miles an hour .  .  .
     At a garage in Quenemo
     I paused for gasolene,
     At Quenemo, in Osage County, Kansas .  .  .
     But the man that ran the place
     With shrill bucolic snicker
     Said: &ldquo;There ain't no gasolene!
     The gasolene in Kansas
     Has all been took and contrabanded,
     Leastways, commandeered,
     Just one hour ago,
     By order of the Governor,
     The Governor of Kansas,
     On account of military operations &ldquo;...
     No gasolene in Kansas!
     And three hundred miles away my love,
     My love, Elvira Simpkins,
     Was waiting for the money I had got from Uncle
          Jethro
     To save the home at Nicodemus
     From the clutch of Jasper Grinder!
     &ldquo;I will telegraph the money!&rdquo; I shouted
     With a flash of inspiration.  .  .
     But the station agent told me,
     &ldquo;There ain't no telegraph nor nothing
     Runs into Nicodemus,
     To Nicodemus, Kansas.
     As fur as I can see in this here book!&rdquo;
      And I looked at the wire from Elvira again
     And saw it had been sent from Happy, Kansas,
     And all the time the precious
     Minutes fluttered by
     Banker Jasper Grinder, in Nicodemus, Kansas,
     Minute after minute,
     Was approaching nearer to the hour of his desire . . .
     I could hear him chuckle,
     The dry and throaty chuckle that village bankers
          chuckle
     In the semi-arid regions
     Another inspiration came to me and I cried:
     &ldquo;I will run my flivver
     To Nicodemus, Kansas,
     On alcohol, by heck!
     I can make the engine in my little flivver
     Run to Nicodemus, Kansas,
     On alcohol, by Henry!&rdquo;
      But the crowd that gathered around me
     Laffed and laffed and laffed . . .
     &ldquo;They ain't no alcohol in Kansas,&rdquo;
      Said the crowd, between its chortles&mdash;
     &ldquo;Kansas is a dry State,
     It's prohibition Kansas,
     And you'll never get to Nicodemus
     Graham County, Kansas,&rdquo;
      Just then the village toper
     A gentle creature and decayed
     Thrust into my hand a gallon
     Of Stutter's Stomach Bitters,
     He handed me four big quarts
     Of Stutter's Stomach Bitters,
     And I poured 'em in the tank and left the town of
     Quenemo, with the engine doing lovely
     And the flivver going strong
     And I reached the town of Skiddy,
     The town of Skiddy, Kansas, in Morris County,
          Kansas,
     And I drew up by the drug store and I yelled
     For Stutter's Stomach Bitters . . .
     &ldquo;I must reach Elvira Simpkins, in Nicodemus,
          Kansas,
     'Ere the clock strikes 12 . . .
     Give me Bitters, give me Bitters!
     Fill the tank with Bitters, for I race to raise the
     mortgage
     But the druggist said: &ldquo;There's been a run on Bitters!
     Considerable colic in this watermelon weather!&mdash;
     How about Stewroona?&rdquo;
      On a gallon of Stewroona I ran from Skiddy, Kansas,
     As far as Elmo, Kansas,
     And there I laid in nineteen quarts
     Of prohibition appetizer:
     Doctor Bunkus's Discovery for Kidneys
     Westward, aver westward;&rdquo;:
     To my love,- Elvira Simpkins
     At Nicodemus, Kansas,
     I ran on Doctor Bunkus, through the dryest belt of
          Kansas,
     Through the prohibition centre,
     Dear Old Doctor Bunkus urged my little flivver;
     From Elmo, to Palacky,
     Six quarts of Lily Gingham's Discovery
     And a dozen more of Bunkus
     Took me nearer, nearer, nearer,
     To my love, Elvira Simpkins .  .  .
     From Palacky west to Pfeifer,
     Through the town of Fingal,
     Then northward to Ogallah,
     I ran on Si wash Injun Soorah,
     A Remedy for Liver Trouble,
     Take a wineglass full before each meal.
     Nearer, ever nearer, to my love at Nicodemus
     From Ogallah north to Happy,
     North to Happy, Kansas, in Graham County,
          Kansas,
     North and west to Happy, word of glorious omen . . .
     And the villagers came down to sniff the glad aroma
     Of the flying flivver
     As I turned north to Nicodemus
     At thirteen minutes until noon,
     Filled once more with! Stutter's Stomach Bitters
     I raced into the presence of my love,' Elvira Simpkins.
     Alas! Alas! Ala:
     Elvira did not clasp me in her sturdy Kansas
           arms
     She sniffed the air and said:
     &ldquo;I never will be wedded
     To a man who reeks with liquor!
     Give me Uncle Jethro's money!
     And don't you leave that drunken flivver on the
           streets of Nicodemus.
     And she went and married Jasper Grinder after all.

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
